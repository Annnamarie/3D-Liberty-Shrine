# 3D-Liberty-Shrine
CS 330 Comp Graphic and Visualization Final Project

Design Software Approach:
  I utilized the shapes given in the starter code and manipulated them in order to mimic the Liberty Shrine scene. My design process was to thoroughly analyze the scene and focus on the main parts such as the actual monument, the bushs around the monument and the sky and ground. By focusing on these I was able to mimic the scene to the best of my ability. I had utilized different objects such as plane, prism, square, torus, etc. I looked into and compared different textures in order to capture the different details and make the scene as realistic as possible. I am particulary happy with how the sky turned out and could work more on the texture of the monument. I also looked into the different sources of lights and how they could be incorporated into the scene in different angles, intensity, and serving different purposes. 
  Analyzing the project throughly and having a good understanding of the requirements helped me with completing this project and will also help me in my future work. I was able to complete all of the required components and incorporate my ideas well.

Developing Program Approach:
  This project made me realize how important it is to have modular and reusable code. The modularity in navigation, lighting, textures, shapes, etc. to render the scene made the code much easier to unsderstand and work off of. It was easy to expand on the starter code and incorporating usefull and easy to understand comments. In the real-world, this is so important because there will be many people working on the same project and in order to work together, clear comments and easy to understand code is crucial.

Reaching Goals:

  This class - computational graphics and visualizations - helped me gain another skill in order to advance in my educational patch. I am currently exploring the different aspects of computer science and this provided me insights and skills if I were to pursue a career in the gaming industry or anything related.
